/// A command to read the device's Log file

/// File commands require that they are the first responder in the chain to consume lines
/// So, to run this command synchronously requires that the Synchronous responder is the first (consuming) responder in the chain
/// (e.g. TSLLoggerResponder can come before it as it does NOT consume the lines it sees)

/// @warning The lines received from the device are not accumulated in the response property
/// and must be handled via the fileLineReceivedBlock
