/// TSLAsciiCommander provides methods to communicate with TSL devices that use the TSL ASCII 2.0 Protocol
///
/// Instances of this class support:
///
/// - connection and disconnection from any TSL Reader paired to the iOS device
///   (including reconnection to that last sucessfully connected device)
/// - execution of a TSLAsciiCommand either synchronously or asynchronously
/// - management of the responder chain for data received from the TSL device
/// - execution of _raw_ TSL ASCII 2.0 commands e.g. `'.iv'`, `'.vr'` etc...
/// - provides notifications when the TSLAsciiCommander changes state e.g. connection/disconnection
///
/// *Important:* All communication with the TSL Device is performed on a separate thread.
/// This has the effect that all TSLAsciiResponders in the responder chain are executed off the main UI thread.
/// Several TSLAsciiCommands make use of delegates for custom processing e.g. the TSLInventoryCommand passes each
/// received transponder to its delegate. Any delegate should be aware that to modify any UI elements will require
/// explicit dispatch to the UI thread e.g. performSelectorOnMainThread:withObject:waitUntilDone: or via dispatch_async()
